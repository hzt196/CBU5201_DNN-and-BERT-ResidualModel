When we reached at the top of the mountain, we found a place on a long, path-paveline and sat down to rest. Many little sparrows appeared in front of us. I was a little surprised.

Our trip lasted two weeks, and during that time we visited several cities, universities, and famous landmarks. One of the most memorable experiences was visiting Harvard University. The campus was exactly like what I have seen in movies. Historic buildings surrounded by lush greenery. I remember standing in front of the Ironique Wanner Library, taking photos, and imagining what it would be like to study here. During our guide tour, the student guide shared fascinating stories of life and hovers, including the traditions and challenges students' faiths. Another unforgettable moment was when we visited Times Square in New York City. The bright lights, giant billboards, and the sheer energy of the place were overwhelming. However, one of the funnest incidents happened at a local dinner when I tried to order a turkey sandwich. I accidentally said chicken instead, and when my order arrived, I was too embarrassed to correct it, so I just ate it quickly.

My day begins with the alarm clock, the in my dorm room. I quickly get up fresh up and rush to the library. I love to the library. It's where my day of learning starts. Some add streams, so the windows and the players pass onto my desk as I open my books and immerse myself in the ocean of the knowledge. I know I meet up with friends in the cafeteria. We enjoy lunch together, we are sharing funny stories and learning experiences. These relaxed conversations are the source of joy in my day. In the afternoon, I usually participate in extreme circular activities. Sometimes it's a basketball game. Sometimes it's a student's console meeting. This activity is re-wrapped by my college life. In the evening, I take a walk on the compass passes enjoying the last bit of peace in the day. I use my phone to capture the beautiful sunset or newly blown flowers by the roadside. The simple movements are precious memories for me. At night, I return to my dorm, organized my notes and prepared for the last day's classes. Before going to bed, I spend some time reading or writing in the imaginal recording the details of the day. As the end of the story, I always look back on my memory moment of the day when it's the quiet at night. So each day seems ordinary.

"The most crowded place ever being is Beijing Underground, especially in Linden, especially during the morning and even in rush hours. It was more torturous that I basically traveled by underground every day. Every morning and evening I squeezed into it underground with a carload of people. The metro is the fastest way to get there and still be on time. The same is Beijing is a supermetropolis and its resident population was statistically less than 20 million years ago. It was a floating population of 20 million. So when you think about it this way there are definitely not enough seats in underground. Basically everyone goes back and grab a seat at the moment door open. And it is interesting to know that in the morning and evening rush hours if you try to get into a carriage, there is a funny way to say that all you have to do is close your eyes and you don't need to lift your legs before you squeeze into the carriage. And you don't have to worry about the lack of handrails because there are enough people for you to stand without falling down. Even if you are not holding to other handrails because others will push you and squeeze you in a firm place.",English,1

Someone's strategy going for a fairway sport to catch the sunset. That sounds beautiful, so we go. We completely miscalculate the time and the route.

We walked along the road, but only finding one sharing shared back. We had three people. We let the most exhausted members to cycle ahead and buy tickets. Fortunately, we arrived in time.

I spent weeks planning everything from the places we'd visit to the restaurants we'd try, but from the moment I landed things started to go wrong. First, my flight was delayed by almost six hours. I was stuck at the airport, feeling tired and annoyed, waiting with no clear idea of when I'd get to leave. When I finally arrived in New York, I discovered that my luggage had been lost. I had to spend over an hour at the airport, filling out forms and talking to airline staff, but nobody could tell me when my bag would be found. When I finally got to my cousin's apartment, I was already in a bad mood. I thought we'd had a nice dinner and catch up, but she told me she had to work late that evening, so I was left on my own in a strange city. I ordered some take-outs, but it wasn't very good, and I spent even the evening feeling lonely and frustrated. The next day, my cousin suggested we visit the central park. I thought this would be the highlight of the trip, but it wasn't. As soon as we got there, it started raining. We didn't have umbrellas, so we ended up getting soaked. The park, which I had always imagined as a beautiful and lively, just felt cold and empty. Then we got into an argument because she thought I was being negative about everything. The tension between us ruined the rest of the day. By the time I flew back home, I was completely exhausted and disappointed. I had spent so much time and effort planning this trip, but nothing had gone the way I had hoped. I couldn't wait to leave and just forget about the whole thing.",English,1

The anticipation of this visit always filled me with excitement, as I knew it promised a brick from the pressure of city life. The moment we crossed the threshold, I was greeted by the freshly baked bread. Grandmother raised her prone, tied around her waist. It would always have a plate of warm cookies waiting for me. My grandfather raised his wet hands and wet smile, would take me on tors of the farm, introducing me to the various animals from the curious, chicken peaking at the ground to the gentle cows grazing in the middle. Based on the farm, we filled with simple joys, I spent hours in the garden helping my grandmother plant flowers and vegetables, learning the names of each plant. In the afternoon, we often got around the old tree in the yard, where my grandfather would tell us the stories of his youngs, his voice carrying the weight of his appearance. Evenings were magical, as the sky transformed into a counter of stars. My grandparents would set up a makeshift telescope and gather with explore the wonders of the cosmos and dreaming of these tentacles. Those summer days, I met grandparents farmhouse, were a time of poor happiness. They taught me the value of hard work, the beauty of nature and the importance of family bonds.

I remember the event, talking at our tracks. As we took in the breath, breathtaking view of the bay. It felt surreal to be standing on such an echo, echoing landmark. While I had always homeless everything in pictures. On our last evening together, we had a few pictures just in time for the sunset. The entire city lay below us with some pending lost guy in beautiful shades of orange and pink. And we went there, through the new hourjacks, for instance the trail.

So, as soon as it was safe to travel, I booked a trip. When I arrived, my friend met me at the airport with a huge hug. It felt like no time had passed. We started the day with breakfast at a small cafe near her apartment. The food and coffee were great and we couldn't stop laughing while sharing stories about our lives. After breakfast, we decided to take a ferry across Sydney Harbour. The weather was perfect and the view of the opera house was stunning. Seeing it in person was completely different from the pictures I had seen. My friend suggested we take a guided tour and it was such a good idea. The guide shared lots of interesting facts like how it took years to build and how its design was chosen in a global competition. We even got to hear a story happening in one of the halls. The sound of the orchestra was amazing. That evening, we were lucky enough to get tickets to a live show at the opera house. The mix of music and dance were incredible. It was one of the best performances I've ever seen. After the show, we walked along the harbour enjoying the city lights and talking about old memories.

"A few years ago, I went on a trip to the United States, specifically to New York City. It was my first time visiting the city, and I was incredibly excited to explore the famous landmarks. Experience the culture and see the city that I had only ever seen in the movies. One afternoon, I decided to take a walk around Central Park. The iconic park in the heart of Manhattan, the sound was shining, and the park was bustling with people enjoying their day. As I walked down one of the quarter past near the edge of the park, I noticed something old. A dog sitting by the sidewalk looking lost and confused. It was a medium sized dog with a scruffy coat, and it seemed like it was waiting for someone. But no one was around. The dog looked up at me when it sat ice, and I could say that it was trying to figure out what to do next. I approached the dog slowly, hoping not to scare it, and to my surprise, it didn't run away or back at me. Instead, it wagged its tail slightly, almost like it was asking for help. I looked around, but the street was empty, and there was no signs of anyone looking for it. My first instinct was to help, so I bent down and gently pated the dog. It was shaking a little, but as soon as I started patting it, the dog seemed to come down. A few minutes later, a woman appeared around the corner, calling the dog's name. The dog immediately cracked up and ran toward her. She looked incredibly relieved and explained that the dog had slipped out of her house earlier that day. And had been missing for hours, she thanked me profusely for staying with her dog and for keeping it calm until she arrived. I felt an overwhelming sense of worth and happiness, knowing that I had played a small role in reuniting the dog with his owner. It was such a simple act of kindness, but it made me realize how much of the difference more decisions can make in someone's life. That day I walked away with a sense of fulfillment, knowing that sometimes being kind and offering a little help can make the world a better place.",English,0

The flight was long, but I enjoyed looking out of the window and sinking about a venture ahead. When I landed at O'Hare Airport, I took a taxi to my hotel. The tail buildings and the bus and the bus street made me feel like a head stacked into a movie. On my second evening, I went for a walk-in along the Chicago River Walk, lies from the tail buildings, reflected on water. And it looked magical. And as I was walking, I noticed a smell of Italian restaurants that didn't seem very busy. I felt curious, I decided to go into and have dinner there. The food was delicious and the place felt very noisy. Well, I was eating. I saw an old man sitting alone at the table near the window. He was catching something in notebook. I couldn't help but ask him about it. He smelled warm rain and invited me to join him. He told me he used to be a chair, a chair-tid and had walked on some Chicago's famous building. Like the well-tower, he showed me some of his sketches, which were amazing and sheer style with his life in the city. I ended up spending hours taking to him, learning about Chicago's history and his table. He made my trip so much more special.

"In 2018, I finally had the chance to visit Tokyo, Japan, a city ahead of the dream of exploring for years. It was a weak long trip and every day was filled with excitement and new experiences. From the moment I landed, I was amazed by how clean and ordinary everything was. The three were bustling with people. Yet, there was a sense of calm and that made the city feel so unique. On my first day, I visited Shibuya Crossing, the world's busiest pedestrian intersection. It was incredible to see hundreds of people crossing the street from every direction at once. Yet, everything moved so smoothly. I stood there for a while, just taking it all in and enjoying the crowd to cross the street myself. It felt like I was part of a movie scene. Later, I wandered through the nearby series filled my way with the strobes and restaurants and tried some delicious street food, including takoyaki and flavor ice cream. The highlight of my trip was visiting the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, as a fan of studio Ghibli films, like British Re and my neighbor's hotel. It felt like stepping into the magical world. The museum was full of musical ex-hatsubits, like a life-size catapult and a famous beautiful hand-drawn sketches from the movies. There was even a small theater where I watched a short animated film, titled exclusive to the museum. It was an unforgettable experience that made me appreciate the creativity behind those movies even more. One day, I took a train to Asakusa to visit Sinsouji Temple. One of the Tokyo's oldest and most famous temples. The main gate with its giant red lantern was so impressive. I walked through the Nakamei shopping street lined with small strobes that in souvenirs and traditional snacks. I bought a little charm for good luck and tried some freshly-made taoyaki, a face-shaped cake filled with sweet red bean paste. Tokyo was everything I had hoped for and more. The mix of modern sky crackers and traditional temples, the traditional food, and the plant and friendly people made it a city like no other. When alive, I feel a little sad, but I knew I would come back one day to explore even more of what Tokyo had to offer.",English,0

"One day, I suddenly received a message from a long lost classmates. Someone in Heldinvey in the Times is for many years. In the last day, his dad, he had been working in another city for the past few years and had just returned to our hometown. He mentioned that he wanted to talk to me with about something. It has been two years since we lost to each other. And thinking back to our high school days, I could help but feel a bit emotional. So I decided to match up with him and catch up. We agreed to match at a quiet coffee. A place I would choose from quickly. I arrived early thinking that since it has been so long since we lost match, he probably had a lot to say. After a while, I finally saw him work into the coffee. He seemed to have hardly charged. So we are really bright and stunning smile. Once we started out, he began talking about past. From tribal silk matters to our lives now. Grandly, the topic started to take a strange turn. He showed me that he had made some investments over the years and met some interesting people, even imagining that he was now having some very complicated business transactions. Listening to this, I was somehow indifferent but did think much about it. However, as we looked at him speaking about his peculiarities, I understood the strange sense of unreliable origin. Looking back, he had been the most natural and person background throughout the conversation. I noticed that he had a mesh in the panoramic and the people I know nothing about. And he had become increasingly mysterious just when I was out to leave. His unique journey picked me to a place to show me his new project. We walked out of the coffee and right in front of the building. He looked like a bearing factory, but he suddenly saw that it was his coffee, his orbit. I was puzzled why would an investor choose such a place while orbiting? Even so, his parents come and told me or told me they were in empty orbit. I started to feel that something was off, but when I turned around, the health drinks seemed unfamiliar. One, I laughed, he said to me, you're all in welcome to come back, we still have lots to cover. After I laughed, I still couldn't start if the night was real or not, especially when being in orbit looked.",English,0
"Last winter break, I made a special trip back to my hometown to visit my grandmother. As a child, going to her house was always the highlight of my year. She would always make my favorite dish, filling the air with a familiar aroma of home and her endless love. Now, as she has a get older, her mobility isn't what it used to be, but she still insisted on cooking for me herself. I urged her to rest, but she just smiled and said, when you are here, I have the stress. Her words filled me with worms and bittersweet filling. Her care and concern for me have always been so deep and thoughtful. During my meal, she recalled stories from a childhood, especially the times when I have climbed onto the mountain to find snakes, my glorious explorers. As she taught them, she loved her tea. Her eyes filled with a facty affection and smell. In that moment, I feel like I was back in those carefree days, enveloped in her and junior love. We remembered, we loved together, and she also shared many family stories I have never heard before. About the hardship of her younger year and how she had raised the family. Hearing the stories, I came to understand not only her hard-earned, but also gained a new appreciation for her life. When it was time to leave, she stood at the door, watching me for a long time. She gazed, filled with both attachment and worry. She slightly hinged, figure, remind me of the passage of time, and made me cherish her presence even more. At the way back, my heart was full of thoughts of family, realizing that they are truly the world-nosed thoughts of support. This visit helped me understand that the best gift we can give our family is our presence, and are resolved to spend more time with her. Trajoring every moment we have together.",English,1

"It was an autumn of julum. I returned to my childhood town to Sima Grand Lala, whom I hadn't lived in years. The town was lively and the same yet it felt both familiar and night.

Where it threw together and the childhood about reason life after eight. But as hand-h has, our conversation turned a little heavier. My grandmother studied talking about the friends she had lost and the good times from the past. I could feel deep sadness because I realised how much time had taken away from us. Even though we tried to stay positive, there was a denying of all sense of loss hanging in the air. Where it was time for me to leave, I had the mix of emotions for the past and uncertainty about the future.

"Few years ago, I visited London with a group of friends. While exploring the city, we stumbled up in a narrow alley lined with all brick walls and Ivey covered arches. At the very end of the alley was a small, almost-hiden bookstore. It's wooden sign, barely legible, from where? Read the silent page. Curiously got the better of me and I stepped it inside the store with dimly lit with shelves that stretched to the ceiling, penned with books of every size and age. The scent of aged paper and wood polish filled the air. As I posted the A-aseless, my eyes were drawn to the killer book, like flat-town high shelf. Unlike the others, I had no title or markings, just a plain, weathered, let me cover. I carefully put it down and opened it. Inside, I found pages filled with handwritten notes in an elegant cursive script. The writing seemed to describe a journey through extraordinary places, the city of eternal highlight and the valley of visbers. This description was vivid, as though the writer had truly been there. As I stood there reading, an elderly woman emerged from behind the killer. Her silver hair was tied back neatly and her pink blue eyes seemed to see right through me. She approached with a warm smile and said, that book has been waiting for you. Her words startled me and I laughed nervously, but seeing when she was joking, but she continued. It's just a reader, you must take it. I hesitated when I asked how much the book cost. She simply waved her hand and said, it's righty yours. Be well-dored but intrigued. I liked the story with the book in hands. Later, I tried to find information about the places mentioned in the text, but my searchers came up empty, even now. The book sits on my shelf. It's this untold. Sometimes I wonder if that bookstore and the mysterious woman were even real.",English,0
"Looking back at my childhood travel, I came to Tibet in the early 12th, where I was in force with this old son. As well as the most magical experience, it was my first time traveling to such a unique state. And even now almost a year later, the memory reminded me my mind. I remember how my dad came running me to a slow, because of the altitude. So of course, the energetic fast-quick. I barely listen until I actually felt the same, making me sad, easy. Mom was constantly making me drink water and watching me like a funk. To our innocence of altitude six minutes. Somehow, the death's personalized made other things feel more adventure. Luckily, we were at the floor on a special mission. The local food was accompanied with a relation to my young past thoughts. I can still remember my first date of age. It was nothing like a fact. At first, I went to my north to the UNIX study, such as Tibet. But by the end of our trip, I was actually asking for more. The island barely was everywhere, in bridge, lakes, and even things. So, altitude is made of walls, quite initially, because of the trees, but enough loving cookies so much. That we bought several cookies home. The last date was three weeks with taking even some minus years of self. The most beautiful weather, colorful, clear, black, late in the winter. And the snow-covered mountains, dancing to treasure clothes. So this is also like stepping into a different world. I remember seeing me as my parents, watching the special times of mountains, in cities of gold and the purple. We were like, we were on top of the world. We made this memory, but truly special now is how it shifts my understanding of culture that was the essential young age. It's amazing how the parents from our childhood continued to express our perspective as they grew older.

"In 2022, I veiled him at Grigrand Father for the first time. He lived in a small, quiet village, surrounded by green hills and fields. Despite being over an IT-year-old, he was still remarkably sharp and full of energy. I had heard many stories about him from my family, but meeting him in person felt like a connection to a new chapter of my heritage. As we said, he has living room. Drinking tea he had prepared. I asked him about my grandfather's childhood. His face lit up with a wolf's mouth as he began to recall the past. Your grandfather was a naughty boy, he said. Drinking tea. But he had a heart of gold. I remember one time when he was about seven years old. He tried to help me plunge rice in the field. Instead of planting the seedlings in the right place, he scattered them all over the place. When I asked him what he was doing, he told me he wanted the rice plants to be free to grow wherever they liked. We both laughed at the photo of my young grandfather running around the field. Completely unaware of the chores he was causing. My grief grandfather then told me about the time when my grandfather sipped a small dog. He found a share of a ring in the ring one day and brought it home, hiding it in his room because he thought I wouldn't let him keep it. When I discovered it, he begged me to let a dog stay, promising he would take care of it. I couldn't say no to his determination. During these stories, I killed as though I was meeting a different person of my grandfather. One boy who was playful, can't and full of dream. My great grandfather's eyes sparked as he spoke, his voice carrying the weight of love and pride. That day, I learned so much more than just a few stories. I gained a different understanding of my family's values and history. It was a video that left lasting impression on my heart. And I promised myself to cherish the story and wisdom passed down through generations.",English,0
"Last summer, I had to visit my childhood home for the last time before it was done. The house which had always been a place of comfort and memories, now empty. As I walked through the room, it seemed to equal with the laughter and the events that had shaped my life. I stood in the living room, remembering the family dinners and gardens that once felt it was warm. The familiar stimuli of old furniture and the bricking of the floor, every scene rushing back. The hardest part was going into my old bedroom. It looks different now. I am the old thing I had feared it was over the years. I walked through the wooden floor where I had a child. I had covered my name with a small knife. I hadn't thought about it in years. But as I run my finger over the groove, I feared a deep dance of nothing. It was like a thing put by a part of myself. After work, I went out to the garden. It was there. I spent countless hours playing as a child. I couldn't live without taking something with me. I picked up a small rock from the ground, a sink or a kitchen. But it felt like taking a piece of the place with me. I split it into my pockets, knowing it might remind me of the house. When I got no longer return, it was a deeply emotional day. As I locked the door behind me for the last time, I realized it was closing the chapter on an important part of my life. The house had shared two artworks, and leaving it felt like leaving behind a piece of my childhood. It wasn't just a house, but it was the memory. The people and the mountains that had made it home. I think it was better that I had imagined, but I know it was time to let go.",English,1

"In the summer of early mid-June, I had the operational to visit San Francisco, a city known for its culture and a sunny national beauty. It was my first time in California and I was eager to explore everything that the city had to offer. I arrived in San Francisco on a sunny morning and the first thing that struck me was an unknown gate bird, touring over the bed with an orange color. I decided to start my trip by taking a walk across the bridge. The wind has a breeze, but the view was breathtaking. As I worked, I could see the view of the crossing against the point of the bridge and the city's skyline sketching out behind me. After crossing the bridge, I made my way to free-fishing my work from one of the most popular tourist spots in the city. The air was flushing with activity, feeling with streets, performers, visitors, zeling fresh seafood and tourists from all over the world. I spotted an awesome, an entire restaurant called Fraulunch. The moon was full of traditional Thailand dishes and I decided to try the homemade pizza with a side of garlic bread. The food was delicious and the warm, inviting atmosphere of the restaurant made me feel right at home. The journey to San Francisco not only allowed me to express the city rich history and diverse culture, but also gave me a deeper impression for the beauty and the warmth of the people I made along the way.

"Last summer, I waited in a small island with my friends and it turned out to be one of the most exciting trips I've ever had. The island was known for its crystal clear waters and vibrant coral reefs. But what exactly caught our attention was the cliff jumping spots and locals recommended and always be a little afraid of highs. But my friends, in this city, it will be an unforgettable experience. We arrived, this place was even more stunning than I had imagined. The cliffs rose high above the tour water. I usually even see those small boats up in the distance. The air was warm and the sound of waves crashing against rocks added to the excitement. A group of locals were already there, you know. Cherry and diving gracefully into the sea below. At first, I had it. Standing at the age of the cliff, I felt my legs for shaking, you know. The hind looked much greater than I had imagined and the song of jumping was terrifying. But my friends encouraged me. They told me that I'd regret if I didn't try. One of them even went first, yelling with joy as they splashed into the water. Their excitement was so crazy, you know. And I finally decided to go for it, I closed my eyes and took a deep risk that I jumped. The moment I felt at age, my fear turned into pure sighting. The wind rushed past me and for a few seconds it felt like I was flying. When it watered, it was cold and refreshing. And I surfaced to the sound of cheers from my friends. I couldn't stop laughing. I feel so alive, so free. And after that first job, I couldn't get enough. We spent the rest of the afternoon taking turns diving into a water and exploring the nearby local roofs.

"As I stepped into the old bookshop, the scent of age paper and leather beauty enveloped me like a warm hug. I have visited this place countless times as a child, often dragging my mother alone, lost in the world of stories. Today I was returning alone, searching for a piece of my past. The shopkeeper, Mr. Wong, was still there. His silver hair and gentle smile unchanged. He looks up from behind the counter. His eyes lighting up. Ah, I remember you.

It has had been years since I had graduated from elementary school, but the memories of my teacher and classmates still line at warmly in my heart.

We set down in a classroom surrounded by the same desk and chairs that had once held our youngful dreams. Mrs. Don asked me about my college life, my major and my future plans. I shared with her of my experience, my achievements and even my struggles. She listened intently, offering words of wisdom and encouragement as always. As we talked, I noticed how little she had had changed. Her smile was still as bright, her eyes still as kind, and her passion for teaching still as pruning. It was as if time has stood still in her classroom, persevering the warmth and love that she had always gave us. Before I left, Mrs. Don handed me a small book filled with notes and messages she had written for me. This is for you, she said softly. Remember, no matter where you are, or where you are, always stay true to yourself and keep pushing your dreams. Well, it really impressed me a lot and that's my story.",English,1

The destination was a farmhouse, deep in the mountains of Guizhou Province. Our group included professional instructors and a bunch of like-minded friends.

He told us he wanted to capture the signs that move sadmost and emphasize that the essence of art is truth, goodness and beauty. On the second day, something dramatic happened. I accidentally twist my ankle and the flat ground at the base, which meant I couldn't go out with the others to sketch. I felt like I was missing out on the vulnerable learning opportunity, but the instructor didn't look over me. He suggested that I focus on sketching and the base and capture the beauty around me. So I started to combine the composition techniques that I had learned from studying and carefully observed every plounts and trees around me. Even though I couldn't go out, I still found plenty of beauty scenes to draw at the base. Such as a depot salad for literally through the leaves and a peaceful life in the farmhouse with chickens and dogs. Even the busy features of my friends all become subjects for my sketches. The sixth day of learning quick, came to the end and everyone showcased their work to my surprise. In the instructor mentioned me specially in his summary, he said the student who gained the most from the trip is one who got injured.
