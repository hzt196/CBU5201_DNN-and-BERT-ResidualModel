 About when we go go, I took a trip to Ainer to see my best friend from high school. There's someone ahead and seen for a really long time. Ainer is such a wonderful place. The sun is shining brightly. The beaches are low and sunny, and the wind feels so good. I feel in love with the big blue sea right away. My classmates and I spent a lot of time walking on the beach. The wind blown it all out of this, made us feel like we were back in high school. Having so much fun together. We talked a lot about our past. We remembered school days, our dreams, and being young. It felt like those days were just yesterday. We also chose Ainer's special food. It was really tasty, and we had a great time eating it. But this trip was more than just about seeing Ainer's beautiful places. It was also a chance to reconnect with my high school friends. We encouraged each other and make a promise to work hard for a better future. It feels so good to be with them again. Not our back home, but I always remember the trip. And to great time ahead with my old friends. Thank you for listening.
