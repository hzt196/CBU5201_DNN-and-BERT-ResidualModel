 Back in 2021, my family and I went to San Yang. As soon as I arrived at the hotel, I couldn't wait to rush to the seaside. Because our hotel was beside the beach, so I can quickly run to the seaside in my swimming tracks. Looking at the spanking sea, I couldn't help shouting and coming. With excitement, I jumped into the water, feeling the cold sea water and basing in the sunshad. My stress was reduced instantly. After swimming in the sea for well, I saw someone playing sea motor near me, watching them traveling one by one on the sea. And it drives my interest. With the nervous and excited feeling, I caught on the jet, on the gardens of the stuff. After several attempts, I quietly left from the rescue and skills. Then I started to light myself up and drove at full speed on the sea. When I was having a good time, I accidentally opened the motor and fell into sea. The cold water woke me up. And under the gullness of my coach, I drove slowly back to the shore. But this later accident didn't affect my happy mood at all. I was really happy during this trip to San Yang. I wanted to back to San Yang more than ever.
