 You know, one day, me and my girlfriend went to a British together and we eat french fries there and we feel very sad because french fries is very test and not very good and we eat some brunch there and brunch is much better than Chinese breakfast and we also eat hydro law in London and you know hydro law there has many there has no server in hydro law and we feel very sad about that so we go to another hotpot hotpot store or restaurant to have the CitroÃ«n hotpot and hotpot is very spicy and it's the most tasty one that I have eaten so I have eaten so you know the hotpot in London is very excellent and I have never tasted such a good hotpot like this before and next so we feel very happy on the first day we learn in London so you know I'm very happy and next step go to Oxford and we also go to the Cambridge to take the food to build the campus of Cambridge and Oxford so I must say it's very beautiful and we don't feel very happy on that day because we can get the permission into this two top college
