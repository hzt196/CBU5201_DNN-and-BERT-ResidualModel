 A week ago, I went on a hiking trip to the mountain with my friends. We just decided that last night we packed our bags with all the essentials like clothes and shoes and something we need to eat and drink. The hike was so challenging but rewarding. We paid a lot of effort to go on the peak. However, we enjoyed the breathtaking views and valley below. At the top, we also watched the sunset, the finesse of accomplishment. Next day, we explored the surrounding... surrounding... ...most and enjoyed meals with my friends.
