 This National Holiday I want to Wuhan is the lake to join our stay over activity. Naturally, the plan revolved around the hacking. East Lake's scenery is great. Perfect for relaxing walks and deep conversations. At least at the beginning I thought the trip was designed to be so. We arrived at the guesthouse around noon on the first day. Someone's strategy going for a fairway sport to catch the sunset. That sounds beautiful, so we go. We completely miscalculate the time and the route. On halfway, we realized that the navigation had let us into a dead end, forcing us to take a lonely tour. By then, we were all running out of energy. Also the clock was ticking. We walked along the road, but only finding one sharing shared back. We had three people. We let the most exhausted members to cycle ahead and buy tickets. Fortunately, we arrived in time. The process was a little bit chaotic, but when we finally watched the sunset, all the efforts are worth it. After the little adventure, we came to a realization that now we are actually caught out for all the physical efforts. We really wanted to sit down and talk, so the rest of our activity shifted to focus. Instead of ambitious plans, we spent most of the time in the guesthouse chatting from noon till midnight. Only when we fully talked out, did we finally head back. Slowly satisfied.
