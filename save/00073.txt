 As the autumn leaves begin to turn golden and crisp, I found myself filled with a sudden urge to revisit my past. It has had been years since I had graduated from elementary school, but the memories of my teacher and classmates still line at warmly in my heart. Among them Mrs. Don, my first great teacher, held a special place. She was not just a teacher, she was a monitor, a guide and a friend. Her patience and kindness had natured my love for learning and shaped my character. With each passing day in college, I realized more and more how much she had influenced me. When sunny afternoon, I decided to take a trip back to my old elementary school. The familiar gaze and playground greeted me with a sense of noise clear. Walking down the corridor, I could almost hear the echoes of my childhood laughter and the sound of me stones. Gentle voice guiding us through lessons. When I reached her classroom, I hesitated for a moment wondering if she would remember me, taking a deep breath and knocked on the door. To my delight, Mrs. Don's face leaped up with recognition and warmth as she opened it. Oh, as you, she exclaimed her eyes twinkling with dry. How have you been? Come in, come in. We set down in a classroom surrounded by the same desk and chairs that had once held our youngful dreams. Mrs. Don asked me about my college life, my major and my future plans. I shared with her of my experience, my achievements and even my struggles. She listened intently, offering words of wisdom and encouragement as always. As we talked, I noticed how little she had had changed. Her smile was still as bright, her eyes still as kind, and her passion for teaching still as pruning. It was as if time has stood still in her classroom, persevering the warmth and love that she had always gave us. Before I left, Mrs. Don handed me a small book filled with notes and messages she had written for me. This is for you, she said softly. Remember, no matter where you are, or where you are, always stay true to yourself and keep pushing your dreams. Well, it really impressed me a lot and that's my story.
