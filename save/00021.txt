 I want to share a story about my daily life. I'm a college student and the way my days are simple. They are filled with my dream and the melody. My day begins with the alarm clock, the in my dorm room. I quickly get up fresh up and rush to the library. I love to the library. It's where my day of learning starts. Some add streams, so the windows and the players pass onto my desk as I open my books and immerse myself in the ocean of the knowledge. I know I meet up with friends in the cafeteria. We enjoy lunch together, we are sharing funny stories and learning experiences. These relaxed conversations are the source of joy in my day. In the afternoon, I usually participate in extreme circular activities. Sometimes it's a basketball game. Sometimes it's a student's console meeting. This activity is re-wrapped by my college life. In the evening, I take a walk on the compass passes enjoying the last bit of peace in the day. I use my phone to capture the beautiful sunset or newly blown flowers by the roadside. The simple movements are precious memories for me. At night, I return to my dorm, organized my notes and prepared for the last day's classes. Before going to bed, I spend some time reading or writing in the imaginal recording the details of the day. As the end of the story, I always look back on my memory moment of the day when it's the quiet at night. So each day seems ordinary. I know that this melody is of daily life or waving into the most beautiful symbol of my life.
