 In the summer of early mid-June, I had the operational to visit San Francisco, a city known for its culture and a sunny national beauty. It was my first time in California and I was eager to explore everything that the city had to offer. I arrived in San Francisco on a sunny morning and the first thing that struck me was an unknown gate bird, touring over the bed with an orange color. I decided to start my trip by taking a walk across the bridge. The wind has a breeze, but the view was breathtaking. As I worked, I could see the view of the crossing against the point of the bridge and the city's skyline sketching out behind me. After crossing the bridge, I made my way to free-fishing my work from one of the most popular tourist spots in the city. The air was flushing with activity, feeling with streets, performers, visitors, zeling fresh seafood and tourists from all over the world. I spotted an awesome, an entire restaurant called Fraulunch. The moon was full of traditional Thailand dishes and I decided to try the homemade pizza with a side of garlic bread. The food was delicious and the warm, inviting atmosphere of the restaurant made me feel right at home. The journey to San Francisco not only allowed me to express the city rich history and diverse culture, but also gave me a deeper impression for the beauty and the warmth of the people I made along the way. Despite the small during of my visit, it left inside blind mark on my heart and I look forward to the day when I can return and explore more of the city.
