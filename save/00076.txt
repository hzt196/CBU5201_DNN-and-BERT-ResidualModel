 I went to Iceland with a few friends. It was a trip. We had been planning since the beginning of the school year. We were also excited to finally experience the nature beauty of the unique country. We landed in... We landed earlier in the morning and even front plane. I could already see the incredible landscape, mountains and other nice fields of rocks covered in most... On our second day, we drove out to a place called... a national park. The trail was basically here. The streets of Antiro's means nothing but natural waters. We even stopped it as the fuel place took pictures of the waterfalls and the mountains in the distance. As we reached here, it was struck by a hallways and open walls. The park is near the place of North America and the western meet. It felt a special understanding between two councils. We spent the day hiking along the trails, talking in the beauty views of the lakes and rivers. At one point, we became across a small past that led to a hidden waterfall. The water was crystal clear and it was full of cool, humid, warm, and warm. Our face and eyes used to be near back. It was so peaceful. There was nowhere else around. There was a sun of water for the original trip. My friends and I sat here for a while, dressed in joy and the clothes beauty of the place. I remember singing a hallways in the walls to find such a perfect spot. Their arms just seemed untouchable by time.
