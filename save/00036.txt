 I'm sorry. Well, I'm going to tell a story that happened recently just a work before. I've been to Tang Jing to which is my best friend which we have, we have no child since nearly a turn years ago. Tang Jing, you know, is a very good city and is very famous for his for the breakfast for the cultural team. So I'm very happy when I launched I launched Tang Jing at the first time because my friend come to take me, take me. So then we go to the very famous place of Tang Jing, Tang Jing and I, just like the London I. I will say I feel a bit disappointed when I see Tang Jing, because he's far more smaller than London eyes in the internet with more really sharpnessy on the TikTok and on the internet. But then I taste some very very delicious Tang Jing breakfast like the Dojiang and something else. It's very delicious and I make my mood feel better. I mean, and then my friend take me to his university. I see that the college student will obviously do that, take their friend to their college university. Well, I see their university is big, large and good. I'm not speaking, I don't feel something about that because it's just a normal university. I don't feel very good or something. And then we then I have to go back to home because I just get to holidays and one day we have spent one day so I have to go back to Beijing. When we left, I feel a bit disappointed and a little bit sad because we haven't met a lot of time before and then we just amounted nearly one and a half days time. But I do believe we can have more time to stay in the future. And then when I see this story now, I don't feel the mood, I just feel happy. This is a very happy memory.
