 Last winter break, I made a special trip back to my hometown to visit my grandmother. As a child, going to her house was always the highlight of my year. She would always make my favorite dish, filling the air with a familiar aroma of home and her endless love. Now, as she has a get older, her mobility isn't what it used to be, but she still insisted on cooking for me herself. I urged her to rest, but she just smiled and said, when you are here, I have the stress. Her words filled me with worms and bittersweet filling. Her care and concern for me have always been so deep and thoughtful. During my meal, she recalled stories from a childhood, especially the times when I have climbed onto the mountain to find snakes, my glorious explorers. As she taught them, she loved her tea. Her eyes filled with a facty affection and smell. In that moment, I feel like I was back in those carefree days, enveloped in her and junior love. We remembered, we loved together, and she also shared many family stories I have never heard before. About the hardship of her younger year and how she had raised the family. Hearing the stories, I came to understand not only her hard-earned, but also gained a new appreciation for her life. When it was time to leave, she stood at the door, watching me for a long time. She gazed, filled with both attachment and worry. She slightly hinged, figure, remind me of the passage of time, and made me cherish her presence even more. At the way back, my heart was full of thoughts of family, realizing that they are truly the world-nosed thoughts of support. This visit helped me understand that the best gift we can give our family is our presence, and are resolved to spend more time with her. Trajoring every moment we have together.
