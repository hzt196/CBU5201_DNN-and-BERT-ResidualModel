 When I was in middle school, I went on a trip to Innan. It was supposed to be a very happy holiday. But after revisiting the Shangri-La and returned to Quming, my young brother suddenly developed an air infection. I really love the beautiful scenery of Innan, especially Shangri-La. We spent the first two days in there and we visited the National Park, admired the clean water of lake, and even tried the local special food, Zempa. My brother and I both especially enjoyed the horseback riding and the instructor carefully selected gentle horses for us. However, when we finished our stay in Shangri-La and returned to Quming, my brother began to feel severe pain in his air. At first, we thought it was just a common air discomfort, but soon he developed a favor and was concerned that he held his air even while sleeping night. We quickly took him to the nearest hospital where the doctor diagnosed him with acute... A tailed media required immediate treatment. Our parents were very worried and after observing my brother's condition for the day without any significant improvement, we had to make a top decision to end the trip early and return home as soon as possible. Under the doctor's guidance, after applying several courses of ultimate, his condition gradually improved. Although the trip didn't end as perfectly as we hoped, it made me realize that the health and happiness of my family are the most important thing.
