 Not a summer, I visited in my cousin who lives near the beach. It was well over the past occasions I have ever had. My cousin's horse is in a small town by the sea. Very great and peaceful. When I arrived, the first scene I noticed was the fresh sea air and the sounds of the waves. My cousin was waiting for me and this band's afternoon, Clenching up. The horse was cosy with lots of plants and big windows. Very well could see the ocean every morning. The old carp earlier and the big carp and walked along the beach as I said. The beach was almost an emergency and it feels like it was stressful for us. The sand was cool under our feet and the waves touched our toes as we walked. Sometimes we would pick up seashells and allow the scene different colors and shapes. It was such a simple thing to do. But I made me feel really happy and relaxed one day. We returned to small boat and went out to see my cousin, new hull to sail and I just enjoyed sitting here, watching the water and feeling the wind. Sadly the salt of his tail were a feel of the sea. Not far from our boat, you jumped out of the water and I had never seen the dolphins in real life before and it was amazing to see them up close. It feels like someone is on TV but it was happening right in front of us.
