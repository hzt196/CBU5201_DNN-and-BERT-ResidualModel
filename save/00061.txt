 Last summer, I had to visit my childhood home for the last time before it was done. The house which had always been a place of comfort and memories, now empty. As I walked through the room, it seemed to equal with the laughter and the events that had shaped my life. I stood in the living room, remembering the family dinners and gardens that once felt it was warm. The familiar stimuli of old furniture and the bricking of the floor, every scene rushing back. The hardest part was going into my old bedroom. It looks different now. I am the old thing I had feared it was over the years. I walked through the wooden floor where I had a child. I had covered my name with a small knife. I hadn't thought about it in years. But as I run my finger over the groove, I feared a deep dance of nothing. It was like a thing put by a part of myself. After work, I went out to the garden. It was there. I spent countless hours playing as a child. I couldn't live without taking something with me. I picked up a small rock from the ground, a sink or a kitchen. But it felt like taking a piece of the place with me. I split it into my pockets, knowing it might remind me of the house. When I got no longer return, it was a deeply emotional day. As I locked the door behind me for the last time, I realized it was closing the chapter on an important part of my life. The house had shared two artworks, and leaving it felt like leaving behind a piece of my childhood. It wasn't just a house, but it was the memory. The people and the mountains that had made it home. I think it was better that I had imagined, but I know it was time to let go.
