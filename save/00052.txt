 It was an autumn of julum. I returned to my childhood town to Sima Grand Lala, whom I hadn't lived in years. The town was lively and the same yet it felt both familiar and night. The streets, the cooler cafe and the row of houses along the main road were all still there, but quite a and the slower than my memories. Following the path of old, I saw rich nightwear manless house. I paused before looking and with the door opened, there was my grandmother. We're hard to tightly. I'm hand-h to wrinkles in her face and the spring colds graze through her hair. But her walls and the lumb remind unchanged. Inside the living room's mount of her cooking, a door with family photos and my child had taught. Everything seemed really unhatched by time, though the room seemed smaller. Where it threw together and the childhood about reason life after eight. But as hand-h has, our conversation turned a little heavier. My grandmother studied talking about the friends she had lost and the good times from the past. I could feel deep sadness because I realised how much time had taken away from us. Even though we tried to stay positive, there was a denying of all sense of loss hanging in the air. Where it was time for me to leave, I had the mix of emotions for the past and uncertainty about the future. A hairdresser my grandmother's hand tied to me and promised her I would come back to visit more often that day and learn that even though time takes so much from us, love and memories are forever.
