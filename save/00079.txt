 I traveled to Europe with my family this summer, living behind many hard-worn mysteries in the process. One night in Munich, my family and I had drinks at a royal court beer house. Because of the brewery reputation guests from all over the world, enjoyed drinking at the tables. It was the first time I drank a liter of beer in one night. And because I was spending time with my family, I dressed felt warm and happy. We enjoyed the local specialties of Munich, such as poor putnails and white sausages. There were not only guests but also two local musicians and the atmosphere was very happy. I was chatting with my family about family matters but suddenly a familiar music came to my ears and that is the classic Chinese song, the one replica represents my heart. I was so excited to hear the so-called hometown sound in the foreign country. After my family and I quietly enjoyed the song, we will know that it was ordered by some colleagues who were having a party and another table. We raised our glasses in the air and offered each other good wishes. It was warm and a helmet moment that I will never forget.
