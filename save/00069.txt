 As I stepped into the old bookshop, the scent of age paper and leather beauty enveloped me like a warm hug. I have visited this place countless times as a child, often dragging my mother alone, lost in the world of stories. Today I was returning alone, searching for a piece of my past. The shopkeeper, Mr. Wong, was still there. His silver hair and gentle smile unchanged. He looks up from behind the counter. His eyes lighting up. Ah, I remember you. You used to come in with your mother, always looking for the venture stories. I know it. A wave just floating over me. I'm looking for something special today, I said. My voice trembling slightly. Something to remind me about her. Mr. Wong's expression softened. He guided me to the corner, filled with forgots and tails. Lastly, browsed, he shared stories about each book's journey. I felt with joy, remembering my mother's love to her, as he reached me in his very shop. Finally, I found it, worn copy of the adventure of Tom Sawyer. It was the last book she reached to me before she passed away. Here's Bream, be my eyes, as I held it to close, as I held it close. Thank you, Mr. Wong, I whispered. His smile knowingly, books have a way of keeping memories alive. As I left, the weight of sadness lives it slightly, replaced by the worms of cherished memories. I knew I would return carrying part of her with me.
