 When I was a young child, Sam Brick, means bouncing above our eyes, a trip to migrant parents' farmhouse in the countryside. The anticipation of this visit always filled me with excitement, as I knew it promised a brick from the pressure of city life. The moment we crossed the threshold, I was greeted by the freshly baked bread. Grandmother raised her prone, tied around her waist. It would always have a plate of warm cookies waiting for me. My grandfather raised his wet hands and wet smile, would take me on tors of the farm, introducing me to the various animals from the curious, chicken peaking at the ground to the gentle cows grazing in the middle. Based on the farm, we filled with simple joys, I spent hours in the garden helping my grandmother plant flowers and vegetables, learning the names of each plant. In the afternoon, we often got around the old tree in the yard, where my grandfather would tell us the stories of his youngs, his voice carrying the weight of his appearance. Evenings were magical, as the sky transformed into a counter of stars. My grandparents would set up a makeshift telescope and gather with explore the wonders of the cosmos and dreaming of these tentacles. Those summer days, I met grandparents farmhouse, were a time of poor happiness. They taught me the value of hard work, the beauty of nature and the importance of family bonds. Even now, as an idol, those memories continued to inspire and nourish my soul.
