 In 2018, I finally had the chance to visit Tokyo, Japan, a city ahead of the dream of exploring for years. It was a weak long trip and every day was filled with excitement and new experiences. From the moment I landed, I was amazed by how clean and ordinary everything was. The three were bustling with people. Yet, there was a sense of calm and that made the city feel so unique. On my first day, I visited Shibuya Crossing, the world's busiest pedestrian intersection. It was incredible to see hundreds of people crossing the street from every direction at once. Yet, everything moved so smoothly. I stood there for a while, just taking it all in and enjoying the crowd to cross the street myself. It felt like I was part of a movie scene. Later, I wandered through the nearby series filled my way with the strobes and restaurants and tried some delicious street food, including takoyaki and flavor ice cream. The highlight of my trip was visiting the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, as a fan of studio Ghibli films, like British Re and my neighbor's hotel. It felt like stepping into the magical world. The museum was full of musical ex-hatsubits, like a life-size catapult and a famous beautiful hand-drawn sketches from the movies. There was even a small theater where I watched a short animated film, titled exclusive to the museum. It was an unforgettable experience that made me appreciate the creativity behind those movies even more. One day, I took a train to Asakusa to visit Sinsouji Temple. One of the Tokyo's oldest and most famous temples. The main gate with its giant red lantern was so impressive. I walked through the Nakamei shopping street lined with small strobes that in souvenirs and traditional snacks. I bought a little charm for good luck and tried some freshly-made taoyaki, a face-shaped cake filled with sweet red bean paste. Tokyo was everything I had hoped for and more. The mix of modern sky crackers and traditional temples, the traditional food, and the plant and friendly people made it a city like no other. When alive, I feel a little sad, but I knew I would come back one day to explore even more of what Tokyo had to offer.
