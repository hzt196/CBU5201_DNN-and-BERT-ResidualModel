 I went to a live house several weeks ago and for meeting my idol she and that was the first time for her to start a live house in Beijing so I changed the opportunity and bought my ticket instantly and when I finally arrived there I saw a lot of things just like me they said that many little gifts were free and that was really happy for me however, cause there are too many people so when I got into the house my place is a little bit far from the stage but it doesn't affect my passion of listening to the beautiful amazing music all these more fantastic things were selected as the lucky one to go on to the stage and take a shot with my idol I was really excited at that time and I couldn't suddenly describe the mood at that time however, it's just so happy
