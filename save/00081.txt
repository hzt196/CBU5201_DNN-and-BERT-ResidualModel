 In counting worms, it was a freezing winter day. The wind was blowing like a knife across my face. I had just experienced the major setback at work and my mood was extremely low. Walking on the deserted street, I didn't know where I should go. When I passed by a coffee shop, the warm light there seemed to have an ease, ease, ease, pleasant, capable attraction, and I couldn't help but working. The shop was filled with a rich aroma of coffee, and smoothly music was flowing in the air. I found a corner and sat down, ordering a cup of coffee, trying to calm myself down. Just then, a girl came over. She had long black hair and bright eyes, with a warm smile on her face. Hello, may I sit here? She pointed to the seat of a seat me. I was a bit surprised but still knew it. After the girl sat down, we started chatting. Her voice was pretty gentle and her words were full of love of life and a positive attitude. She shared with me her travel experiences, the good books she had read, and the interesting people she had met. In her narration, I seemed to see a cold for war, a war without troubles and setbacks, only endless beauty and hope. Before I knew it, my mood had gradually improved. When we were about to leave, the girl handed me a piece of paper with a sentence written on it. There will always be tough times in life, but please believe that something one for is about to happen. I watched her working way and my heart was full of emotion. Since whenever I encountered difficulties and setbacks, I always think of that girl and her words. She is like a warm ray of sunlight in the past and ahead of me in my darkest moments. This chance encounter has become an unforgettable experience in my life. It has made me understand that even in the coldest winter, there will be warmth as long as we feel and discover our hearts. There is beauty everywhere in your life.
