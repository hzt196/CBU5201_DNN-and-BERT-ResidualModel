 Last summer, I visited Boston for a short getaway. It was my first time in this city. And I was excited to explore history and culture. I started my trip by walking the Freedom Trail. A path that takes me to a shoe song of most historic site in the city. Along the way, I saw a famous pro-revere house and an old North Church. And I learned a lot about American revolution. I also stuff as Fenera Hall, where I heard street performers playing jazz music. The south of their instrument mixed with the chatter of stories created a lively atmosphere. The next day, I visited Harvard University in the nearby Cambridge, walking through the campus. I felt a sense of inspiration. It was like stepping into a world-well ideas and innovations through three. I spent some time in the Harvard's Museum of Natural History, looking at the habits of fossil and dinosaur skeletons. The museum was quiet. And air inside smelled like old wood and dust, which made it feel even more like a place of discovery. In the evening, I had dinner as a small seafood restaurant by the harbor. I joined a place of fresh laughter while watching the sunset over the water. The city had a vibrant, red-clown, calm energy, and it made me realize how much there is to learn, and its parents' in places with such deep history.
