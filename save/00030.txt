 In night of the day, I traveled to Chicago for a walk-making. It was my first time visiting the United States and I felt both excited and the best, scared, scared. The flight was long, but I enjoyed looking out of the window and sinking about a venture ahead. When I landed at O'Hare Airport, I took a taxi to my hotel. The tail buildings and the bus and the bus street made me feel like a head stacked into a movie. On my second evening, I went for a walk-in along the Chicago River Walk, lies from the tail buildings, reflected on water. And it looked magical. And as I was walking, I noticed a smell of Italian restaurants that didn't seem very busy. I felt curious, I decided to go into and have dinner there. The food was delicious and the place felt very noisy. Well, I was eating. I saw an old man sitting alone at the table near the window. He was catching something in notebook. I couldn't help but ask him about it. He smelled warm rain and invited me to join him. He told me he used to be a chair, a chair-tid and had walked on some Chicago's famous building. Like the well-tower, he showed me some of his sketches, which were amazing and sheer style with his life in the city. I ended up spending hours taking to him, learning about Chicago's history and his table. He made my trip so much more special. Although I didn't have time to explore everything in the city, the memories dealt with me, I helped. I can return to Chicago one day to create more memories like this.
