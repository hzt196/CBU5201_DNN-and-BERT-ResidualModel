 It was, it was a time I back to two souls and then 14 and it has been years since we came all together with my family. We go to a renewing and ask the lakeside cabin and then I remember the lake was surrounded by towering pines. We have been years to reunion together. I fell and make sure of joy and anxiety in the air. We still come next to it as we once did. This is sun dipped by the horizon, casting the golden hue over the lake. We share stories and memories around the fire. My cousin Sarah, always the drunk teller, had everyone in the switch with her impressions. I felt the worms of bellowing wash over me, laughter echoing into the night. Yet I missed the drawer I noticed my uncle sitting quietly on the edge of the dark, staring into the water. He had lost his wife a year ago. And though she's his my old times, the sand as in his eyes was palpable. I felt pound of sorrow for him knowing how difficult it was to navigate leaves of grief. Gathering my courage, I walked over and said behind him. Hey Uncle Tom, want to talk? I asked gently. He looked at me. Surprise flicking in his eyes. We spoke about Sunday May, sharing stories that made us smile and cry. In that moment I felt a connection deeper than he'll after share around life. Loving loss. It was a reminder that family balance can heal even the most profound wants.
