 Story is an adventure at the old bookstore. On the leaves of sunny afternoon, I was wondering endlessly on the street. By accident, I turned into a rather out of the way alley. The alley was filled with an old smile and as if time had slowed down there. Suddenly an old basketball came and all the bookstore came into view. The bookstore was simple and messy. With several yellow books placed randomly. By its plink book erection, I worked closer to the bookstore and started rummaging through the books. I wore an old book with a damaged cover caught my attention. Just as I picked up this book to examine it carefully, and old boys came from beside me. Young man, you like this book too? I looked up and saw an old man with grey hair smelling at me. The old man was sitting on a small stool beside, with a lung in his eyes that was both profound and wise. We started chatting about this book, and the old man told the story behind it, which was legend about courage, perseverance, and dreams. I was completely captivated as if I hadn't been taken into another world. As the chat went deeper, I discovered that the old man had a rich life experience. He used to be a brave adventure, having traveled to many places where few people had been. He was also a scholar who loved reading and had profound insights into various kinds of knowledge. His stories gave me a new understanding and perception of life. Before I knew it, it was already getting dark. I set good light to the old man and left early with that old book and heart of harvest. This chance in contact was like a bright star. Emelute illuminating my ordinary life. Since then, whenever I see this old book, I always think of that afternoon. The old bookstore, Fall of Stories, and the admirable old man. It has made me understand there are surprises and miracles everywhere in life, as long as we have a heart that is good at discovering.
