 Last autumn, I visited Hangzhou with my friends. It was my first time there. And I was very excited. Hangzhou is famous for rest late. So we went there on the first morning. The lake was very beautiful. With mountains in the distance and both floating on the water. The air was fresh. And we all looked at a tent. We rented a small boat and enjoyed the peaceful scenery. The boatman told us stories about the lake. Like the legend of the wet snake. It was interesting to hear. After we visited the Lingyin Temple. The temple was quite a full of history. Tiao Tui surrounded the area. And the smell of incense filled the air. Inside, with many stale and older parrots. It was a peaceful place where we could rest and sing. The trip to Hangzhou was relaxing and fun. I will always remember its natural beauty and the delicious food.
