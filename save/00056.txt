 Few years ago, I visited London with a group of friends. While exploring the city, we stumbled up in a narrow alley lined with all brick walls and Ivey covered arches. At the very end of the alley was a small, almost-hiden bookstore. It's wooden sign, barely legible, from where? Read the silent page. Curiously got the better of me and I stepped it inside the store with dimly lit with shelves that stretched to the ceiling, penned with books of every size and age. The scent of aged paper and wood polish filled the air. As I posted the A-aseless, my eyes were drawn to the killer book, like flat-town high shelf. Unlike the others, I had no title or markings, just a plain, weathered, let me cover. I carefully put it down and opened it. Inside, I found pages filled with handwritten notes in an elegant cursive script. The writing seemed to describe a journey through extraordinary places, the city of eternal highlight and the valley of visbers. This description was vivid, as though the writer had truly been there. As I stood there reading, an elderly woman emerged from behind the killer. Her silver hair was tied back neatly and her pink blue eyes seemed to see right through me. She approached with a warm smile and said, that book has been waiting for you. Her words startled me and I laughed nervously, but seeing when she was joking, but she continued. It's just a reader, you must take it. I hesitated when I asked how much the book cost. She simply waved her hand and said, it's righty yours. Be well-dored but intrigued. I liked the story with the book in hands. Later, I tried to find information about the places mentioned in the text, but my searchers came up empty, even now. The book sits on my shelf. It's this untold. Sometimes I wonder if that bookstore and the mysterious woman were even real.
