 Since I was a kid, I've always had a deep interest in sketching and drawing. I went somewhere in high school, I signed up for the sketching trip organized by my school. The destination was a farmhouse, deep in the mountains of Guizhou Province. Our group included professional instructors and a bunch of like-minded friends. The instructor was a recently required college professor who not only had wealth of experience but also the passion for art. He told us he wanted to capture the signs that move sadmost and emphasize that the essence of art is truth, goodness and beauty. On the second day, something dramatic happened. I accidentally twist my ankle and the flat ground at the base, which meant I couldn't go out with the others to sketch. I felt like I was missing out on the vulnerable learning opportunity, but the instructor didn't look over me. He suggested that I focus on sketching and the base and capture the beauty around me. So I started to combine the composition techniques that I had learned from studying and carefully observed every plounts and trees around me. Even though I couldn't go out, I still found plenty of beauty scenes to draw at the base. Such as a depot salad for literally through the leaves and a peaceful life in the farmhouse with chickens and dogs. Even the busy features of my friends all become subjects for my sketches. The sixth day of learning quick, came to the end and everyone showcased their work to my surprise. In the instructor mentioned me specially in his summary, he said the student who gained the most from the trip is one who got injured. I realized that the true essence of art might be to fill every detail of life with my heart and capture those moments that move me with my pen.
