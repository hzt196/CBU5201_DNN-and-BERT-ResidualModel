 One day, my friends and I decided to go hiking our life's non-tree. We lived earlier and the weather was sunny. The wave of mountains were beautiful. Half we are resettling here, a faint cry. So I first thought it was just a wind but it got louder and sound like someone needed help. So we followed the sound and found a smile coat trapped in some rocks. It seems like it just lost a way and couldn't escape. So we quickly decided to help it and I used a rope from my backpack to put the girls out. It looked like us and they run back to the region. I realized that we didn't just save an animal but we showing show the teamwork and courage in a tough situation. So we continued to the 12th and the wave there was invited. So we feel very good. So I learned that even a smell active health can help a big difference and I became more respectful of nature and life. It's a really wonderful day so we can do something very meaningful.
