 In 2017, I visited Paris. It was a city I always wanted to see. I arrived earlier in the morning and the airport. And when I went straight to my hometown near Péthatore, I was so excited that I decided to start exploring right way. The first place I went to was the Péthatore. It was still morning. So there were not too many people. I took my time to look at the swamp from the ground before taking the elevator up. When I reached the top, the view was amazing. I could see the Hosey with the scenery and all the busy streets. I stayed here for a long time throughout the lunar night. I was feeling so happy to be in Paris. The sun was shining and it felt like a dream come true. After visiting the Hosey, I walked to the Duan Museum. The museum is huge and I knew I would not be able to see everything in one day. So I chose a few famous pieces to see. The Mona Lisa was much smaller than I expected. But I was still so special to see it in real life. I also loved the winter victory and other things. Walking through the museum felt like I was traveling back in time. Sounded by so many people for an old scene.
