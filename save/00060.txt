 In 2022, I veiled him at Grigrand Father for the first time. He lived in a small, quiet village, surrounded by green hills and fields. Despite being over an IT-year-old, he was still remarkably sharp and full of energy. I had heard many stories about him from my family, but meeting him in person felt like a connection to a new chapter of my heritage. As we said, he has living room. Drinking tea he had prepared. I asked him about my grandfather's childhood. His face lit up with a wolf's mouth as he began to recall the past. Your grandfather was a naughty boy, he said. Drinking tea. But he had a heart of gold. I remember one time when he was about seven years old. He tried to help me plunge rice in the field. Instead of planting the seedlings in the right place, he scattered them all over the place. When I asked him what he was doing, he told me he wanted the rice plants to be free to grow wherever they liked. We both laughed at the photo of my young grandfather running around the field. Completely unaware of the chores he was causing. My grief grandfather then told me about the time when my grandfather sipped a small dog. He found a share of a ring in the ring one day and brought it home, hiding it in his room because he thought I wouldn't let him keep it. When I discovered it, he begged me to let a dog stay, promising he would take care of it. I couldn't say no to his determination. During these stories, I killed as though I was meeting a different person of my grandfather. One boy who was playful, can't and full of dream. My great grandfather's eyes sparked as he spoke, his voice carrying the weight of love and pride. That day, I learned so much more than just a few stories. I gained a different understanding of my family's values and history. It was a video that left lasting impression on my heart. And I promised myself to cherish the story and wisdom passed down through generations.
