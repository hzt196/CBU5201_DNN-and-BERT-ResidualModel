 In May of this year, I went to a concert on my favorite idol. It was the first time I traveled alone to a foreign country just for a long awaited appointment. The decision was made in a hurry. I made up my mind only a month or so before the concert and I had to prepare all the things for going abroad by myself. It was a stressful and anxiety-ridden process, but happiness I had been waiting for the staying me through it all. At concert, I met my idol, who I've loved for a long time, shining brightly on the stage, and fans who loved them as much as I do, waving their sports sticks and singing along with them. At this concert, I heard one of my favorite songs, which inspired me when I was lost. For the smile that browned with tears, the moment is the face again. Let's go now. When I was at concert, the vivid vitality of my favorite idols standing on the stage was contagious to me. I came running across the obstacles and the moment I saw them, all the hard work during the preparation dissipated, living only happiness. I don't regret this trip brought a lot because the brave enjoyed the world first. The music is a song that I've been singing for a long time. I've been singing for a long time. I've been singing for a long time. I've been singing for a long time. I've been singing for a long time. I've been singing for a long time.
