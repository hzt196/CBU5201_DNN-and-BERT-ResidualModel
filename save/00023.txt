 Winter of 2022. It was Chinese New Year and our family follows the Hong Kong tradition to raise my grandmas horse, which is also my mom's place. The day was bright and sunny. Dad, mom, glad, my brother and I drove over to my mom's, which is changed New Year greeting with each other. And after the greetings, mom's lived some radars, in the hopes to relate ones, lead ones at the grandmas, and talk them to study hard and work hard. Work hard as more wise and meanwhile, then I also got radar in one of the delivery by my grandmother and uncle. Then we said in the courtyard, so came in sunshine chatting with each other. Suddenly someone suggested, hey, let's play some poker cards. I jumped up right away and said, yes, I want to play. So I quickly got the poker card card and then we all stepped into a game of poker. We were all having so much fun.
