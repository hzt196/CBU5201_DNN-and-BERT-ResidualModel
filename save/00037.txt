 And this is my story. A few years ago, my sister and I went to Hong Kong and one of the highlights of our trip was visited in Lan Quay for a popular bar this trip. It was our first time there and we were excited to experience the re-brand tonight life that we had the hard, heard so much about. The narrow streets were filled with people and the energy was the electric music layered from all directions and the last four and the latter approached down the alleys. That night there was some kind of event where people drive up as different characters. We saw superheroes, cartoon figures and even some historical characteristic characters. Walking around, it felt like we were a movie or found a bar. That looked interesting and went in. The atmosphere was lovely with people dancing, singing along to popular songs and just having a good night. My sister and ordered some drinks and drawn in the fall. We danced last and even made a few new friends who were also visited from other places.
