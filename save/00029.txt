 A few years ago, I went on a trip to the United States, specifically to New York City. It was my first time visiting the city, and I was incredibly excited to explore the famous landmarks. Experience the culture and see the city that I had only ever seen in the movies. One afternoon, I decided to take a walk around Central Park. The iconic park in the heart of Manhattan, the sound was shining, and the park was bustling with people enjoying their day. As I walked down one of the quarter past near the edge of the park, I noticed something old. A dog sitting by the sidewalk looking lost and confused. It was a medium sized dog with a scruffy coat, and it seemed like it was waiting for someone. But no one was around. The dog looked up at me when it sat ice, and I could say that it was trying to figure out what to do next. I approached the dog slowly, hoping not to scare it, and to my surprise, it didn't run away or back at me. Instead, it wagged its tail slightly, almost like it was asking for help. I looked around, but the street was empty, and there was no signs of anyone looking for it. My first instinct was to help, so I bent down and gently pated the dog. It was shaking a little, but as soon as I started patting it, the dog seemed to come down. A few minutes later, a woman appeared around the corner, calling the dog's name. The dog immediately cracked up and ran toward her. She looked incredibly relieved and explained that the dog had slipped out of her house earlier that day. And had been missing for hours, she thanked me profusely for staying with her dog and for keeping it calm until she arrived. I felt an overwhelming sense of worth and happiness, knowing that I had played a small role in reuniting the dog with his owner. It was such a simple act of kindness, but it made me realize how much of the difference more decisions can make in someone's life. That day I walked away with a sense of fulfillment, knowing that sometimes being kind and offering a little help can make the world a better place.
