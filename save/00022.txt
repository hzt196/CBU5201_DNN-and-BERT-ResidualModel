 The most crowded place ever being is Beijing Underground, especially in Linden, especially during the morning and even in rush hours. It was more torturous that I basically traveled by underground every day. Every morning and evening I squeezed into it underground with a carload of people. The metro is the fastest way to get there and still be on time. The same is Beijing is a supermetropolis and its resident population was statistically less than 20 million years ago. It was a floating population of 20 million. So when you think about it this way there are definitely not enough seats in underground. Basically everyone goes back and grab a seat at the moment door open. And it is interesting to know that in the morning and evening rush hours if you try to get into a carriage, there is a funny way to say that all you have to do is close your eyes and you don't need to lift your legs before you squeeze into the carriage. And you don't have to worry about the lack of handrails because there are enough people for you to stand without falling down. Even if you are not holding to other handrails because others will push you and squeeze you in a firm place.
