 I've never caught COVID-19, which seems pretty lucky into this world. Back in early 2020, when the pandemic first started spreading globally, I was still in high school. Suddenly, the news was all about the virus, and our school announced a shutdown, switching all classes to online learning. We all felt pretty uneasy and scared at that time. At the pandemic, our city went into lockdown. My family set up a strict preventive measures, such as washing hands frequently, and we're remarks and keeping social distance. During this period, I started learning how to cook and try out all sorts of recipes. The kitchen became a lab, and every day I come up with new dishes. During the second wave of the pandemic, I decided to join volunteer groups to help the elderly and vulnerable in our community. We delivered essential supplies and helped them with daily tasks. Even though it was a small act, saying zero smiles made me feel that my efforts were worth it. However, the pandemic didn't end as quickly as we hoped. As restriction is the end of the life, starting again back to normal, many of my relatives and friends got COVID-19. Some even more than once. Despite this, I never get infected or felt any symptoms. I could also look back on that unique period to do with the pandemic, reflecting on how unperioded both life can be and how resilient people are.
