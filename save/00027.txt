 In 2021, I visited my best friend Sarah. In 2021, I visited my best friend Sarah in San Francisco. We hadn't seen such each other in the early two years due to the pandemic. And finally, meeting her, again with all the incredible heartwarming. She greeted me as though airport was a huge mail. And I couldn't stop talking the whole red back to her place. Sarah had moved into a small bottle of cozy apartments looking on one of those steep hills. San Francisco was famous for. From her window, we could see cable cars going by and it felt like something out of our way. To remind me this, Sarah made it her mission to show me all her favorite places in the city. We went to Golden Gate Park where we spent hours working through gardens. Watching petal goes on the lake and even visitings of Japanese tea garden, the peacefulness and off the garden. Missed carefully, a drunken road, and a flowing stream. It felt like I always used to miss the busy city life. We also took a walk across the Golden Gate Bridge. And it was a very day. I remember the event, talking at our tracks. As we took in the breath, breathtaking view of the bay. It felt surreal to be standing on such an echo, echoing landmark. While I had always homeless everything in pictures. On our last evening together, we had a few pictures just in time for the sunset. The entire city lay below us with some pending lost guy in beautiful shades of orange and pink. And we went there, through the new hourjacks, for instance the trail. Talking about our dreams, and how much had changed in the past couple of years. It was a moment of reconnection, and I realized that despite the time and distance, our bond had a strong desire.
